# basic-bug-bunny-game-
I created this just for some practice on pygame.
This is a video game just for fun for kids, just for fun and with no difficult levels.
Player runs across the screen to collect eatables, and cries when eats a chilli, but it can be avoided by firing a bullet with spacebar or player can jump over it with 'ctrl'(both left and right) and arrow keys are for movement of player.
When player reaches the end of screen, all sprite objects of previous screen are deleted and new screen is generated every time with repositioning of background and screen objects. 
Game runs for infinite screens.
Anyone can use, practice on this game. Suggesions and updates are welcomed.
